This project uses ROS and Gazebo to create a simulation where autonomous vehicles can follow lanes and respond to traffic lights.

Lane Tracking:

Detects and follows lanes using cameras and image processing.
Controls the vehicle to stay in the correct lane.
Traffic Light Control:

Detects traffic light colors (red, yellow, green).
Stops or moves the vehicle based on the traffic light.
The project tests these functions in a simulated environment, ensuring that the vehicle can safely and correctly navigate while following lanes and traffic signals.
